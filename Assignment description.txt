ASSIGNMENT
----------------
Word predictor) Most modern mobile phones have some kind of word prediction software. As
you are typing a word in a text message or an e-mail, the word predictor displays a shortlist
of the most probable completions of the word. The list of suggestions is updated for each
keystroke the user makes. If one of the suggestions indeed is the word you intended to type,
you can type the word just by clicking on it, thereby saving many keystrokes.
Such a system must have a language model to be able to suggest the next word. The task in
this project is to

1. implement word prediction using two different language models,
a) one based on n-gram models,
b) and one based on neural networks. The neural-network-based model can be
implemented using a feed-forward network, as described in section 7.5 in the textbook (and
lecture 8a), and/or an RNN as described in section 9.3 in the textbook (and lecture 8b).

2. implement some simple interface to show how your word prediction works

3. evaluate by computing the proportion of saved keystrokes using different models and inputs




REPORT
-------------------------------
Describe your project work in a written report in English. The report should be no more than 8 pages + optional appendix with data examples, diagrams, or similar. It should typically include an introduction, background, a brief description of your implementation, method for testing/evaluation, results, conclusions, and references.

Note that 8 pages is the max and not the target. Quality is more important than quantity!

Please upload

the report
the code you have written + a README describing how to execute it
any data you have collected (but not pre-existing data I can download myself)
